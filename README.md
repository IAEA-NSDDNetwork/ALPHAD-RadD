 This ALPHAD_RadD code is an extension of original ALPHAD code that automatically deduces radius parameter (r0) for odd-A and odd-odd alpha emitters, employing the April 2018 file of r0 parameters deduced for 182 even-even alpha emitters (an update of previous 1998 file 1998Ak04) by S. Dhindsa et al.
Additionally, the code has an option of inputting user-supplied radius parameter.

Note: some bugs in the original ALPHAD code have also been resolved.
